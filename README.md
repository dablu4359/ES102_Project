# ES102_Project
Hello there!

This is simple python project. I wrote the code that runs in terminal. We can use this to store the Bank-Account data of the customers of your bank.

I have used 3 modules of python to make this project.
  1) pickle
  2) os
  3) pathlib

If you want to run this code in your system, first you have to import this modules.
